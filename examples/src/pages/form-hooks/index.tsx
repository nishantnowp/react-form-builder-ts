/**
 * Wrapper for the Composable Form Hooks Pattern Example.
 *
 * This example demonstrates a powerful pattern for managing complex
 * form-related logic by composing multiple, small, single-responsibility
 * custom hooks. This keeps components clean and logic maintainable.
 *
 * Key features demonstrated:
 * - Separation of concerns using custom hooks (`useSearchState`, `useSearchResults`).
 * - Composing hooks to build complex state.
 * - Performance optimization with `useMemo`.
 * - Clean and readable component code.
